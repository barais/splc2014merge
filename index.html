# Towards Managing Variability in the Safety Design of an Automotive Hall Effect Sensor

![Approach](images/approach.jpg "Approach overview")

# Domain model: Melody advance (ARCADIA / CAPELLA), A FIELD-PROVEN MODELING SOLUTION FOR SYSTEM AND SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE ENGINEERING

The Melody ecosystem is a field-proven modeling solution offering an environment with a high added-value for engineers working on system, software and hardware architectures. At the center of this ecosystem is a graphical modeling workbench supporting the Arcadia engineering method. Arcadia mainly focuses on functional analysis, (complex) architecture definition and early validation. Both the method and its supporting ecosystem are currently widely deployed in the Thales Group, in all domains across several countries, thanks to a massive rollout of model-based approaches.

Arcadia becomes publicly available and Melody goes Open Source!

#Variability Modelling: CVL
Variability Modeling is to efficiently describe more than one variant of a system. Variability modeling is often closely associated with product lines. The resulting systems are often fairly complex and variations are described explicitly. Variability can be expressed in stand-alone models, such as feature diagrams. Software Product Lines refer to methods, tools and techniques for creating and maintaining a collection of similar software systems from a shared set of software assets.
The intention of variability modeling is to create and manage many variants of a product, also known as mass customization. Variability modeling is regarded as the enabling technology for delivering a wide variety of software systems of high quality in a fast, consistent and comprehensive way. The key is to build a base on the commonalities and efficiently express and manage the variability of the systems. Variability can also be described in annotations or extensions to the base model, or totally separated out to represent in an independent variability model.

The Common Variability Language (CVL) is a domain-independent language for specifying and resolving variability. It facilitates the specification and resolution of variability over any instance of any language defined using a MOF-based meta-model.

#KCVL

KCVL is an open-source initiative to implement a CVL editor using Kermeta, Xtext and Sirius

#Variability Checking: Familiar


FAMILIAR project
feature models, variability, software product lines, configuration, domain-specific language, automated reasoning, model-driven engineering

GitHub Profile
FAMILIAR (for FeAture Model scrIpt Language for manIpulation and Automatic Reasoning) is a language for importing, exporting, composing, decomposing, editing, configuring, computing "diffs", refactoring, reverse engineering, testing, and reasoning about (multiple) feature models. All these operations can be combined to realize complex variability management tasks (screencast/demonstration).

FAMILIAR was originally created at I3S laboratory by Mathieu Acher, Philippe Collet and Philippe Lahire and is now jointly and openly managed by the Triskell team (INRIA / IRISA / University of Rennes 1), the MODALIS team (I3S laboratory, University of Nice Sophia Antipolis) and at Colorado State University (USA).

#Editor Tooling: Sirius

Sirius enables the specification of a modeling workbench in termes of graphical, table or tree editors with validation rules and actions using declarative descriptions. All shape characteristics and behaviors can be easily configured with a minimum technical knowledge. This description is dynamically interpreted to materialize the workbench within the Eclipse IDE. No code generation is involved, the specifier of the workbench can have instant feedback while adapting the description. Once completed, the modeling workbench can be deployed as a standard Eclipse plugin.

Sirius believes in the power of dedicated representations to analyze specific problems. Sirius provides a set of customizable and highly dynamic representations working seamlessly together on top of models. These representations can be combined and customized according to the concept of Viewpoint, inspired from the ISO/IEC-42010 standard. Views, dedicated to a specific Viewpoint can adapt both their display and behavior depending on the model state and on the current concern. The same information can also be simultaneously represented through diagram, table or tree editors.
